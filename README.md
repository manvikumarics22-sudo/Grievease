# Grievease
GrievEase is a smart CRM platform for citizen complaints and service requests. It ensures faster resolutions, real-time updates, and transparent governance.
It is a citizen grievance management CRM system designed to simplify how people interact with local and regional governments. It provides a single web and mobile platform where citizens can submit complaints, upload supporting documents, request authorized services, and track progress in real time with SMS/email updates. For government officials, GrievEase offers a centralized dashboard to assign, monitor, and resolve cases efficiently, with built-in escalation workflows and performance analytics. By combining automation, transparency, and accountability, the project aims to reduce delays, improve service delivery, and strengthen trust between citizens and government.
